      <p id="quotes">
        “Nothing is so painful to the human mind as a great and sudden change.”
        “Beware; for I am fearless, and therefore powerful.” “Life, although it
        may only be an accumulation of anguish, is dear to me, and I will defend
        it.” “I do know that for the sympathy of one living being, I would make
        peace with all. I have love in me the likes of which you can scarcely
        imagine and rage the likes of which you would not believe. If I cannot
        satisfy the one, I will indulge the other.” “There is something at work
        in my soul, which I do not understand.” “If I cannot inspire love, I
        will cause fear!” “I ought to be thy Adam, but I am rather the fallen
        angel...” “Even broken in spirit as he is, no one can feel more deeply
        than he does the beauties of nature. The starry sky, the sea, and every
        sight afforded by these wonderful regions, seems still to have the power
        of elevating his soul from earth. Such a man has a double existence: he
        may suffer misery, and be overwhelmed by disappointments; yet, when he
        has retired into himself, he will be like a celestial spirit that has a
        halo around him, within whose circle no grief or folly ventures.” “...
        the companions of our childhood always possess a certain power over our
        minds which hardly any later friend can obtain.” “How mutable are our
        feelings, and how strange is that clinging love we have of life even in
        the excess of misery!” “It is true, we shall be monsters, cut off from
        all the world; but on that account we shall be more attached to one
        another.” “The fallen angel becomes a malignant devil. Yet even that
        enemy of God and man had friends and associates in his desolation; I am
        alone.” “I was benevolent and good; misery made me a fiend. Make me
        happy, and I shall again be virtuous.” “The world to me was a secret,
        which I desired to discover; to her it was a vacancy, which she sought
        to people with imaginations of her own.” “When falsehood can look so
        like the truth, who can assure themselves of certain happiness?”
        “Hateful day when I received life!' I exclaimed in agony. 'Accursed
        creator! Why did you form a monster so hideous that even you turned from
        me in disgust? God, in pity, made man beautiful and alluring, after his
        own image; but my form is a filthy type of yours, more horrid even from
        the very resemblance. Satan had his companions, fellow-devils, to admire
        and encourage him; but I am solitary and abhorred.'” “The whole series
        of my life appeared to me as a dream; I sometimes doubted if indeed it
        were all true, for it never presented itself to my mind with the force
        of reality.” “Man," I cried, "how ignorant art thou in thy pride of
        wisdom!” “The world was to me a secret which I desired to devine.”
        “Listen to me, Frankenstein. You accuse me of murder; and yet you would,
        with a satisfied conscience, destroy your own creature. Oh, praise the
        eternal justice of man!” “I am alone and miserable. Only someone as ugly
        as I am could love me.” “I could not understand why men who knew all
        about good and evil could hate and kill each other.” “With how many
        things are we on the brink of becoming acquainted, if cowardice or
        carelessness did not restrain our inquiries.” “Thus strangely are our
        souls constructed, and by slight ligaments are we bound to prosperity
        and ruin.” “Learn from me, if not by my precepts, at least by my
        example, how dangerous is the acquirement of knowledge, and how much
        happier that man is who believes his native town to be his world, than
        he who aspires to become greater than his nature will allow.” “Nothing
        is more painful to the human mind than, after the feelings have been
        worked up by a quick succession of events, the dead calmness of inaction
        and certainty which follows and deprives the soul both of hope and
        fear.” “It may...be judged indecent in me to come forward on this
        occasion; but when I see a fellow-creature about to perish through the
        cowardice of her pretended friends, I wish to be allowed to speak, that
        I may say what I know of her character.” “if I see but one smile on your
        lips when we meet, occasioned by this or any other exertion of mine, I
        shall need no other happiness.” “I am malicious because I am miserable”
